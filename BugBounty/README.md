# Angular Bug Bounty & Security Audit Dossier

This folder contains a consolidated knowledge base for security researchers and auditors focusing on the Angular framework. It captures the official bug bounty program details, scope, reporting processes, and historical security context.

## How to Use This Dossier
- **Auditors:** Use [Historical-Issues.md](./Historical-Issues.md) to identify recurring bug classes and [Scope.md](./Scope.md) to understand the boundaries of the audit.
- **Researchers:** Follow the [Submission-Checklist.md](./Submission-Checklist.md) to ensure high-quality reports that meet Google OSS VRP standards.
- **Program Updates:** Refer to [Program-Overview.md](./Program-Overview.md) for the latest reward tiers and reporting channels.

## Program in 60 Seconds
Angular is a **Flagship OSS Project** under the **Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Reward Program (OSS VRP)**. Vulnerabilities should be reported via the [Google Bug Hunters portal](https://bughunters.google.com/report). Rewards for critical supply-chain compromises can reach up to **$31,337**, while product vulnerabilities (like XSS in the framework) are rewarded up to **$7,500**. The program covers the core Angular repositories, their configuration, and certain third-party dependency impacts.
